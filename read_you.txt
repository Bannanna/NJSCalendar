**year['2015'].month['03'].day['15'].hour['1600']**

directories are symbolic months in a symbolic year directory. Days are .txt
files within months. The application will parse these directories and display
the results in an html rendered page. A command line interface is provided for quickly
editing the <01,...,30>.txt files. A web application is provided for graphical
display of the days. Nice and simple.
